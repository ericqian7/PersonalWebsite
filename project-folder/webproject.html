    <h2>Something New</h2>
      <p>This summer, I decided I wanted to learn how to create my own wesbite. However it turned out to be a more difficult endeavor than I anticipated.
      </p>
      <p>Being a CS major, I wanted to create my website using HTML/CSS rather than through a website builder, like SquareSpace.
      </p>
      <p>I had seen some HTML code before when I tinkered with webscraping, but my experience with HTML and CSS was essentially non existent.</p>
    
      <p>For my learning, I decided to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=9040s&ab_channel=SuperSimpleDev" style="color: rgb(35, 78, 112)" target="_blank">this</a> Youtube tutorial. Each lesson was well explained and I got a basic idea of the elementary HTML/CSS concepts like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML Structure</li>
        <li>CSS Grid</li>
        <li>Flexbox</li>
        <li>Divs</uli>
      </ul>
      <h2>Blueprint</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to sketch out the rough idea of my website in Paint. I wanted to keep it simple, look relatively good, and be something I could be proud of.
      </p>
      <p>For colors I wanted the website to be primarily royal blue (#234E70) and pale yellow (#FBF8BE).  </p>
      <p>
        The website would be divied into 3 sections - Projects, Cooking, and Misc. Each would have relevant items and items would be displayed as a grid to keep the layout consistent.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, I wanted a permanent header that always displayed as you scrolled through items in each section. (As of writing there is not enough items to see this effect)</p>

      <p>
        And then came time to write the website.
      </p>
        <h2>Roadblock</h2>
      <p>Everything seemed fine and dandy while brainstorming, but while staring at a blank "website" it's hard to start.</p>
      <p>Learning concepts in bite-sized 10-15 minutes was relatively hard, but applying these concepts to create a website was a different beast.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I held out on creating my website that day. And the next. And that week. And the following week.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Completion
      </h2>
      <p>Often the hardest part is taking the first step. That first sentence in an essay. The first step in a marathon. But once you do, everything else falls into place.</p>
      <p>Now of course, my website is not the best out there. Far from it. My HTML/CSS is not the most consise. I probably used some frowned upon writing conventions in my code that'll hurt in the future.</p>
      <p>My writing isn't amazing. The website isn't the most pleasing on the eyes.</p>
      <p>But over the course of 3 weeks of learning and 2 weeks of creating, I finished. </p>
      <p>My goals were to make a website that was simple, looked decent, and something I could be proud of.</p>
