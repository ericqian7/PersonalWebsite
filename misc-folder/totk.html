  <h2>Breath of the Wild's Sequel</h2>
    <p>I've always enjoyed Zelda games but Breath of the Wild is what made me truly love the franchise.
    </p>
    <p>The game is absolutely beautiful and there is seemingly endless amounts of things to do.
    </p>
    <p>So when the sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, was announced, I knew I had to get it on release day.</p>
  
   
    <h2>Tears of The Kingdom</h2>
    <p>
      This game is just as gorgeous as Breath of the Wild, but with twice the amount of things to do.
    </p>
    <p>The building and fusing mechanic introduces a new layer of creativity. I'm also really enjoying the new outfits offered in this game.  </p>
    <p>
      As of now I am nowhere close to beating the game and I'm perfectly fine with that. Slowly discovering everything the game has to offer makes each playing session fun.
