  <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Chili Lime Chicken Wings</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pound chicken wings</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 tsp papripka powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Put chicken wings in a bowl. Add spices and mix well with wings. 
      Optional: Marinate wings in fridge.
    </p>
    <p>Airfry wings for 30-32 minutes at 375 degrees farenheit, 
      flipping the wings in the fryer halfway through.
    </p>
    <p>Wings are good to consume now but I would recommend creating a sauce
      to complement the wings.</p>
    <h3>Sauce recipe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lime</li>
      <li>1 tsp honey</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chili oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I don't usually have chili oil on hand but it can be made 
      by heating up some oil, adding roughly chopped dried chili peppers,
      a minced garlic clove, and some paprika powder.
    </p>
    <p>In a sauce pan, melt the butter. Add chili oil and squeeze limes in. Stir.
    </p>
    <p>
    Add the honey as well as lime zest. Mix with wings and enjoy.
    </p>
    <h3>These chili lime wings are insanely good and very easy to make.
      The wings are a perfect blend of spicy and tangy, with a hint of sweetness from the honey.
