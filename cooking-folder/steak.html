  <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">T-Bone Steak</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>T-bone steak</li>
    <li>Sea salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
    <li>Garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>I've only just started experimenting with steaks. The method I've cooked them is with a cast iron skillet.
    </p>
    <p>First heat up the skillet until it's smoking hot. Then add olive oil, just enough to fully coat the pan.
    </p>
    <p>While waiting for pan to heat up, season both sides and edges of steak with salt and pepper. Use a generous amount - steak loses around 30% of seasoning in cooking process!</p>
    <p>Place steak in pan. When placing, lay it away from you, so you don't get splashed with oil.</p>
   <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>I cook the first side for about 6 minutes. This is where I like to add the garlic and rosemary too. I like to cook at medium high heat for this step.
    </p>
    <p>I've learned  it's best to keep movement of the steak to a minimum so I leave it there untouched, until it's time to flip.
    </p>
    <p>
    After 6 minutes, flip and add butter to the pan.
    </p>
    <h3>Basting</h3>
    <p>Tilt the pan towards you so the melting butter is easily reached. Use a spoon and continuously splash the steak with the liquid butter.</p>
    <p>When I flip the steak and start basting, I usually turn the heat down. The pan is already very hot and it's important to not burn the butter.</p>
    <h2>Final Steps</h2>
    <p>After 6 minutes of basting, the steak is done and is somewhere between a medium to medium rare. Allow the steak to rest for 10 minutes before cutting. </p>

    <h3>This steak isn't the most technical, but the flavor and juiciness makes it perfect for a casual dinner. Bonus: Any leftovers can be made into a steak and egg bagel!</h3>
